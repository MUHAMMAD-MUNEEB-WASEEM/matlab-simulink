***********OTHER THINGS IN REPORT OTHER THAN TASK OR STARTING*************

1. Hardware heading in starting

I will provide hardware image tomorrow which will be placed under hardware heading

2. Data from Arduino

i. Arduino code should be their to get voltage and speed from Dc motor

ii. One table which consist of three columns. First column is of time in seconds (0-19 seconds like 0, 1,2 etc), second one is of voltage
    and third one is of speed. All readings are present in excel data file

iii. After this attach voltage and speed response graph. 


*********************REGARDING TASKS*****************************

1. DC motor control method:

Method used is armature control method

2. first task is optional so I have not done this. If I will get time then I will do this otherwise not necessary

3. second task from images like transfer function image

4. Third task from images of step, impulse response

5. Fourth task Routh criteria. I will do this on A4 paper and send it and will be attached under Routh criteria heading

6. fifth task. Add rlocus image and pzmap image 

7. sixth task is optional so I have not done this

8. Bode plot is optional but I have done this. Attach Bode plot image


Also write Wordings, important points related to each task along with introduction, conclusion etc in which you are already mastered.
